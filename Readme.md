# Cryptojacker Detection Project

This project aims to detect cryptojackers using dynamic analysis in Python. The main goal is to extract features relevant for the detection of a cryptojacker.

## Components

The project consists of several Python scripts each serving a specific purpose:

- `libcalls.py`: This script is used to monitor DLL library calls.
- `newinteg.py`:feature extraction after monitoring all the features for 40 seconds
- `start.py` :startup script

## Usage

To use these scripts, simply run them with Python. For example:
    
   
    pip install -r  "requirements.txt"
