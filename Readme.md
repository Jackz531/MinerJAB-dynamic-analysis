# Cryptojacker Detection Project

This project aims to detect cryptojackers using dynamic analysis in Python. The main goal is to extract features relevant for the detection of a cryptojacker.

## Components

The project consists of several Python scripts each serving a specific purpose:

- `cpu_usage.py`: This script is used to monitor the CPU usage.
- `network_monitor.py`: This script is used to monitor network usage.
- `libcalls.py`: This script is used to monitor DLL library calls.
- `integrated_nw_cpu.py`: This script is used to view everything.

## Usage

To use these scripts, simply run them with Python. For example:
    
    ```bash
    pip install -r  "requirements.txt"
    ```
